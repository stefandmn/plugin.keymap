# Keymap Editor Plugin for MCPi

**Keymap Plugin** has been adopted and redesigned to make Clue MCPi 
media player compatible with any Renderer device (TV display or monitor). 
The plugin creates specific user keymaps for any remote control for any 
TV and/or monitor.
 
This plugin was design to run over ___Clue OS___ but it might work also 
on any Kodi version, over any _Debian_ operating system installed on RPi 
appliances.
